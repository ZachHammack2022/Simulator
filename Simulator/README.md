This project consists of two main parts. The first part is a simulation of the ASTB-E, a test that measures predicted success in Naval Flight School. This simulation will help applicants practice for the ASTB-E and increase their chances of being accepted to Naval Flight School. In this simulation the user simultaneously tracks simultaneous targets and completes additional complex tasks. The second part consists of three mini-games. These mini-games ask the user to use the joystick and throttle in new ways that challenge their ability to handle the instruments in new and exciting ways. The mini-games will help with user engagement and instrument proficiency.

Buttons

There are two players. Control the right player with the arrow keys. Control the left player with the w and s keys. You score points and add time remaining by colliding with the gray enemies.

Joystick

The game is the exact same as before, except you now control the right player with the mouse/joystick instead of the arrow keys. The mouse/joystick must be over the window to work. To maximize effectiveness, maximize the window so that the mouse/joystick will not go outside of the boundaries for the window.

Complete

This game builds on the joystick game. You continue tracking two enemies simultaneously, but you can now begin emergency situation tasks and the dichotic listening task. 

To begin the dichotic listening task, press 1. Then, whenever you hear an even number in your right ear, press 2. Whenever you hear an odd number in your right ear, press 3. If you hear a letter in your right ear, do nothing. 

To begin the emergency situation tasks, press 0. When you see that there is a fire, press f and spacebar to fix the situation. When you see there is an explosion, press e and ; to fix the situation. When you see that there are enemy missiles, press m to fix the situation. You should write these down on paper just as you would during the ASTB-E to make sure you can respond quickly and effectively to maximize your score. 

Mini-Game 1

Control the player by moving the joystick/mouse. Collide with the gray enemy while avoiding blocks as they appear. Beware blocks that spawn immediately next to your current location. Press the spacebar if you are ever in a spot where you are unable to reach the enemy because of the blocks. This will reset the blocks so that you will be able to reach the enemy.

Mini-Game 2

Control the blue player with the mouse/joystick and the red player using the wasd keys. Collide into enemies to gain points and reach higher levels. The game mechanics here are very similar to Mini-Game 1. 

Mini-Game 3

Control the right player with the joystick/mouse and the left player with the ws keys. Click whenever you are confident you are on target. you will gain extra points for being accurate and lose points for being inaccurate.
